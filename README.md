# Predicting Socioeconomic and Environmental Influences on Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Urban Neighborhoods

### This repository is code collection of my work on science research project. 

#### The work was divided into following steps 
- Find the right source of environmental and socioeconomic data 
- Download and the data and process it. 
- Identify right features for the model and develop the code 
- Test and visualize the model performance and repeat the process as needed. 


#### The code is structured accordingly. 
- Pythod code for data preparation, model and analysis is under code folder 
- Since data files are large, I stored them in google-drive.
